# JavaLib_OpenWebif
This is a library to work with the interface provided by the [OpenWebif](https://github.com/E2OpenPlugins/e2openplugin-OpenWebif) plugin for Enigma2-based set-top boxes (STBs).
`JavaLib_OpenWebif` depends on `JavaLib_JSON_Parser`.

### Usage / Development
The current state of this library is compatible with JAVA 17. But most of its code should be compatible with JAVA 8.  
This is an Eclipse project. `.classpath` and `.project` files are contained in the repository.  
`JavaLib_OpenWebif` depends on `JavaLib_JSON_Parser`. This dependency is made via "project import" in Eclipse.
If you want to use this library / clone this repository, you should clone `JavaLib_JSON_Parser` too and put it into the same Eclipse workspace.
